# High-Efficient-CIGS-based-Solar-Cell using SCAPs-1D

Abstract:
To simulate the high efficiency CIGS(Cu(In,Ga)Se2) based Solar Cell using SCAPs 1D tool and analyze the influence of buffer layer on the CIGS-based Solar cell. Also PV parameters are calculated for different buffer layer (CdS,ZnS,ZnSe) and find the alternative of CdS.  

Introduction:
CIGS is important material for terrestrial based solar cells  applications because of their high efficiency, long-term stable performance and potential for low-cost production. Thin film solar-cells with polycrystalline Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS ) absorber layers provide a good alternative to wafer based crystalline silicon solar cells, which currently constitute the major share of photovoltaics installed and used worldwide. The CIGS based solar cells exhibit excellent outdoor stability, radiation hardness and highest efficiencies (19.2%). 
These compounds are direct bandgap semiconductors which minimize the requirement for long minority carrier diffusion lengths. 
Such p-type semiconductors with high absorption coefficient are the promising absorbing materials for thin film photovoltaic technology.
Buffer layer is an intermediate layer film between the absorber and window layers with two main objectives, 
A.  to provide structural stability to the device &
B.  to fix the electrostatic conditions inside the absorber layer.
Cadmium sulphide (CdS) is a prominent candidate to be used a buffer layer in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 based solar cell. 
Note that Cadmium (Cd) is a metal that can cause severe toxicity in humans and the environment.
